# group-project
This is our program that asks the user for their favorite number and their name. It takes the user's imput to the two questions and combines them into one statement.

```python
name = input("Hi! What is your name?") ## has the user input their name
favNum = input("What's your favorite number?") ## input of a number

```

In order to install our software, you can use the command git clone followed by the URL of the repository on JupyterLab. Since our code is written using Python, the file should end with .py so that it runs properly.

If you would like to contribute to the program, fork the code by using the button on GitHub and test changes. Send a pull request if you would like to sumbit your changes.
